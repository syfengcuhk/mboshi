S. Feng, P. \.Zelasko, L. Moro{-}Vel{\'{a}}zquez and O. Scharenborg, "Unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery by Leveraging a Language-independent Subword Discriminative Feature Representation", submitted to INTERSPEECH 2021.

Task:
Unsupervised acoustic unit discovery

Databases:
Evaluation: Mboshi, freely available for academic use.
Training: Globalphone 5 languages (Czech, French, Spanish, Mandarin and Thai), 8 Babel languages (Cantonese, Bengali, Vietnamese, Lao, Zulu, Amharic, Javanese and Georgian). Please note that GlobalPhone and IARPA BABEL Language resources are *NOT* freely available.


Evaluation metrics:
(1) Normalized mutual information (NMI): a measure of clustering quality
(2) F-score: a measure of segmentation quality
Please refer to https://github.com/beer-asr/beer ([1]) for evaluation software.

See our paper for details of the approach.
